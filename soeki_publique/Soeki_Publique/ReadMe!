Hi!

Build 24022000 Instructions:

First Networking Stuff implemented!

Please test landscape editing in "Join Game" mode with a loopback
connection *only*!

Note that the net stuff is in a very early and untested stage. A lot
of things will be very buggy.

Attacking etc. is disabled. The blocking-map gets cluttered up after
a while, so unit collosion doesn't work right in this release.

Usage (from Terminal):

Soeki [server ip (defaults to 127.0.0.1, i.e. loopback)]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build 15012000 Instructions:

- Added Keyboard support. Supported Keys (As I remember them):

	- s		Saves height (and light?) data to map/MapShot.dat
	- l		Same as above, only loads
	- g		Toggles Z-Buffer display mode (funky)
	- q		Quits (no more qualifier hacking)
	- Ctrl		Forces Attack (Hold strg and click on another unit to
						let em fire)
	- t		Toggles texture to be applied (in Editmode)
	- m		Toggles landscape manipulator (experiment!)

- Smooth (semi-smooth) scrolling. Diagonal even works in some
  lucky cases!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Instructions (from the original alpha version):

To work correctly, place this folder to:

/boot/home/code/ 
(please create those folders if necessary)

And start "Soeki" in the soeki folder either via Tracker, or better,
a Terminal window.

Please always bear in mind that this is just a bug-drenched development
version and in no way showing anything final.

Regards,
Lukas Hartmann
